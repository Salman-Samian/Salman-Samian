Hi, I am Salman Samian, a senior front-end developer. since 2018, I have worked extensively with React.js, Next.js, Tailwind, and React Native to build exceptional mobile and web applications. I am also proficient in TypeScript, which I have used in my front-end projects.

As someone who enjoys taking on complex challenges, I am able to evaluate solutions and select the most effective ones based on my extensive experience.

My development approach focuses on usability and practicality, always keeping in mind the strengths and limitations of each technology. I have experience working with a variety of development tools, including VS Code, Google Cloud, Firebase services, and AWS services.
